#Manukiran Kamath, 1002068674, manukiran.kamath@mail.utoronto.ca

Part 1 Explanation:
1. We use : dig utoronto.ca +short to get the IPv4 address
2. Using dig utoronto.ca we can find both the name servers, and both use the same IPv4
3. We use dig utoronto.ca MX to get the mail server info
4. We run the BIND server on one terminal, and on another we send a DNS query dig @<server address> utoronto.ca -p <BIND listening port #> to confirm our answers match in subparts 1-3.

Part 2 Explanation:
Our proxy is constructed as follows:
We create a socket and bind to our proxy's port (--port arg) and then listen for an incoming dig request. When we get this, we send a DNS query to the upstream BIND server, and then wait for it's response. Once this is done, we forward the response back to the address and port that we got from the initial client (dig).
